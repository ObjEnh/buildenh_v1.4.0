# buildenh_v1.4.0
The software package 'buildenh_v1.4.0' enhances the classification results of remote sensing imagery by generalizing the content and vectorizing the irregular outlines of imaged objects. Vector data of urban environments are generated in an automated way and with high cartographic quality. The user may monitor the intermediate results which are displayed graphically together with the source data. The derived coordinates of the corner points may be stored together with a label in topographic databases and Geographic Information Systems. The package has the potential to contribute to national and private mapping projects and to crowd sourcing. It is a new version and replaces the previous version (buildenh_v1.3). 

A detailed description of the package 'buildenh_v1.4.0' and an installation guide are located in the directory '/docs'. All R scripts are in the /R directory. Supporting scripts may be found in the '/support' directory and solutions for special objects (buildings) can be collected in the directory '/spObj'. The package is started by the program 'startup_buildenh_v1.4.0.R'.
